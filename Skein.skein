A large metallic cube rests dead center in a small room, enclosed by smooth, dark walls. Thick tubes snake out from the base of the cube, disappearing into the floor in all directions. Harsh sunlight spills through a jagged hole in the ceiling, illuminating the area and casting an eerie glow over the door to the east. A small computer terminal juts up from the floor to the side of the cube.

The ruins of what was once a long, enclosed hallway extend before you. The ceiling has almost entirely collapsed, littering the floor with rubble. The center of the south wall has been smashed inward, revealing the front half of a long-since disabled hovertank. The main gun barrel of the damaged tank extends across the hallway, and appears to have collided with the northward door, ripping it from its frame. Doors stand to the east and west.

The main gun barrel of the damaged tank extends across the hallway, and appears to have collided with the northward door, ripping it from its frame. Doors stand to the east and west.

Road SR-1
The ruins of what was once a long, enclosed hallway extend before you. The ceiling has almost entirely collapsed, littering the floor with rubble. The center of the south wall has been smashed inward, revealing the front half of a long-since disabled hovertank. The main gun barrel of the damaged tank extends across the hallway, and appears to have collided with the northward door, ripping it from its frame. Doors stand to the east and west.

Absolute darkness and silence fall around you. For a fleeting moment, you experience nothing whatsoever. 

 A single line of white text blinks into view, hovering motionless in the black void. 

 …initiating startup sequence…　 

 Somewhere far away, yet somehow closing in, a motor springs to life. Warmth flows over you, spreading outwards from below. You feel your head suddenly spring into existence behind your eyes, followed closely by your torso, arms, and legs.

A large metallic cube rests dead center in a small room, enclosed by smooth, dark walls. Thick tubes snake out from the base of the cube, disappearing into the floor in all directions. Harsh sunlight spills through a jagged hole in the ceiling, illuminating the area and casting an eerie glow over the door to the east. A small computer terminal juts up from the floor to the side of the cube.

Road SR-1
The ruins of what was once a long, enclosed hallway extend before you. The ceiling has almost entirely collapsed, littering the floor with rubble. The center of the south wall has been smashed inward, revealing the front half of a long-since disabled hovertank. The main gun barrel of the damaged tank extends across the hallway, and appears to have collided with the northward door, ripping it from its frame. Doors stand to the east and west.

A large metallic cube rests dead center in a small room, enclosed by smooth, dark walls. Thick tubes snake out from the base of the cube, disappearing into the floor in all directions. Harsh sunlight spills through a jagged hole in the ceiling, illuminating the area and casting an eerie glow over the door to the east. A small computer terminal juts up from the floor to the side of the cube.
You can see Door BT-1 here.

Absolute darkness and silence fall around you. For a fleeting moment, you experience nothing whatsoever. 

 A single line of white text blinks into view, hovering motionless in the black void. 

 …initiating startup sequence…　 

 Somewhere far away, a motor springs to life. Warmth flows over you, spreading outwards from below. You feel your head suddenly spring into existence behind your eyes, followed closely by your torso, arms, and legs.

The ruins of what was once a long, enclosed hallway extend before you. The ceiling has almost entirely collapsed, littering the floor with rubble. The center of the south wall has been smashed inward, revealing the front half of a long-since disabled hovertank. The main gun barrel of the damaged tank extends across the hallway, and appears to have collided with the northward door, ripping it from its frame. Doors stand to the east and west.

Refuge R-1
You stand in a large room, surrounded by heavily-armored walls. Orange holographic letters float in a tight circle over the center of the area, displaying the message &quot;Welcome Home&quot;. An energy shield covers the area, distorting your view of the sky. One corner of the refuge contains several universal charging stations and an AMS-5 repair node.

 A single line of white text blinks into view, hovering motionless in the black void. 

 …initiating startup sequence…　 

 Somewhere far away, a motor springs to life. Warmth flows over you, spreading outwards from below. You feel your head suddenly spring into existence behind your eyes, followed closely by your torso, arms, and legs.

A large metallic cube rests dead center in a small room, enclosed by smooth, dark walls. Thick tubes snake out from the base of the cube, disappearing into the floor in all directions. Harsh sunlight spills through a jagged hole in the ceiling, illuminating the area and casting an eerie glow over the door to the east. A small computer terminal juts up from the floor to the side of the cube.
