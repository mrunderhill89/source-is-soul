Chapter - General Rules

A module is a kind of thing.

Chapter - Corruption

A module has a number called corruption level. 
The corruption level of a module is usually 0.

Definition: a module is corrupted if the corruption level of the noun >= 50.

The description of a module is usually "[The noun] capacity: [capacity of the noun]."

To say capacity of (m - a module):
	let corruption be the corruption level of m;
	if corruption is 0: 
		say "optimal";
	else if corruption < 25: 
		say "sufficient";
	else if corruption < 50: 
		say "impaired";
	else if corruption < 75: 
		say "damaged";
	else: 
		say "corrupted".
		
An object has an indexed text called the corrupted description.

Chapter - The Player

The description of the player is "[if the player is digital]You are currently intangible.[else][physical diagnostic][end if]".
The corrupted description of the player is "[virus threat]".

To say physical diagnostic:
	say "Physical Diagnostic:".

[The body terminal represents where the player is in digital space, while the player's body stays where it is in physical space when the player goes somewhere]
There is an object called player's body. The printed name is "your body". It is undescribed. Understand "my body" as player's body. 

There is an object called player's terminal. It is in Terminal B-6.
Instead of taking the player's terminal:
	transfer the player out.

Instead of dropping the player's body, say "It is not possible to totally exit your body without accessing a computer terminal first".

Carry out entering the player's body:
	move the player's body to the location of the player;
	move the player to the player's body.

To transfer the player to (destination - a room):
	if the destination is digital:
		move the player's body to the location of the player;

		move the player's terminal to the destination.

To transfer the player out:

	[word corruption]
	repeat with i running from 1 to the number of words in N:
		if j > the number of words in C:
			let j be 1;
		let chance be a random number between 25 and 100;
		if corruption > chance:
			replace word number i in N with word number j in C;
		increment j;
	[repeated corrupted examinations raise corruption level]
