Section - Command Prompt

When play begins: now the command prompt is "(".


Chapter - Examined / Unexamined

A thing can be examined or unexamined. A thing is usually unexamined. After examining something: now the noun is examined; continue the action.

Chapter - The Player

Section - General Rules

The description of the player is "[if the player is in a digital region]You are currently intangible.[else][physical diagnostic][end if]".

Section - Status Readouts

The description of the status readouts is "The fuel draw sign indicates an abnormally high amount of hydrogen fuel is present in the reactor.[if plant schematics are examined] This seems to run contrary to what the schematics indicated would happen in the case of a regular malfunction.[end if]".
The corrupted description of the status readouts is "The warning signs seem to have faded for now. All systems are reporting normally.".

Section - Plant Schematics

The description of the plant schematics is "You take in the digital form of the plant's schematics and process them within a few minutes. The plant is a Wildcat-Class fusion reactor that runs on pressurized hydrogen fuel. You find a reference to emergency procedures in case of plasma containment failure. Though not quite an 'explosion,' the plant's core can potentially build up an excess of plasma that could vaporize approximately 20 cubic kilometers from the origin if the containment were to fail." 

Carry out switching on the safety override system:
	now the Power Plant Hatch is unlocked.

Report switching on the safety override system:
	say "All of a sudden, warning lights flash and klaxons start blaring incessantly. The readouts begin showering lines of unrecognizable code.".

[Instead of using the core access terminal:
		say "The locking bolts on the hatch release and slide back out of sight, granting access to the core below.";
		now Power Plant Hatch PPH-1 is unlocked;]
	
Power Plant Core PPC-1 is a room. The description is "You are as close to the power plant's core as you can be without being exposed to the internal plasma. [if the fusion reactor is unstable]You detect large fluctuations in the core's containment shielding, indicating that it is about to fail.[else]The core's output appears stable.[end if]"

[I have no idea how fusion reactors work. This one's radioactive and explosive apparently.]
[Kevin: Fusion reactors are basically miniature stars fueled by hydrogen. I'm not an expert, but from what I studied a while back, the way fuel is injected into the reactor is theorized to be pretty safe. At worst, the fusion reaction simply runs out of fuel and the reactor shuts down. The fact that fuel is still being pumped into this reactor, and to the point of causing an explosion, should be a clue that the plant is being actively sabotaged (by the virus, which the player doesn't know is sentient yet). Radiation is still an issue, but not as much as in regular nuclear reactors. The bigger issue with fusion reactors are leaks of white-hot plasma. Maybe if we wanted to screw with the player's expectations, we could have the corrupted descriptions describe a regular nuclear reactor instead, like mentioning control rods or something that fusion reactors don't have.]

	After entering PPC-1 while the fusion reactor is unstable, say "As you get closer to the core, you impose a positive charge in your external armor to deflect the small, high-energy plasma particles leaking from the reactor containment. The makeshift shield holds for now, but it is putting a constant drain on your energy reserves, and it won't do much in the case of complete containment failure. You should work quickly."

	The fusion reactor is scenery. The fusion reactor can be unstable or stable. The fusion reactor is unstable.

Power Plant Hatch PPH-1 is a locked door. It is below PP-2 and above Power Plant Core PPC-1.

The fuel injector is a thing in PPC-1. The description is "The fuel injector for the power plant core. [if the examination module is corrupted]Push the control rods further into the reactor to stabilize the core. [else if the plant schematics are examined]The schematics said that the injector can be closed off manually to stop the fusion reaction.[end if]".

Instead of closing the fuel injector:
	say "You find the manual control for the fuel injector and close it off. The reactor shuts down for a moment before emergency power comes back online. The computer terminals continue to protest that the reactor is going critical before shutting down. Was this the virus the damaged robot was talking about?";
	now the fusion reactor is stable.

Instead of pushing the fuel injector:
	say "You struggle to push the control rods in... only to remember that fusion reactors don't have control rods. Where did you hear that idea?"

Part - Infected Robot Camp

Security Door IC is a locked door. It is west of RP-2 and east of Infected Robot Camp IC-1.
Security Door IC can be damaged or undamaged. Door IC is damaged. [We can change this to undamaged if we want.]
The description is "The physical door has been torn away, but the energy shield over the opening is still active. Through the energy field, a desolate patch of land sits in the shadow of the power plant, its soil pockmarked with small charred craters. An uprooted power conduit sends wires snaking across the ground, running up in to the power ports of fifty dark, motionless robots. The silent machines stand in rows of ten, their collective, unmoving gaze fixed on the white tower."

Infected Robot Camp IC-1 is a room.

The description is "A desolate patch of land sits in the shadow of the power plant, its soil pockmarked with small charred craters. An uprooted power conduit sends wires snaking across the ground, running up in to the power ports of fifty dark, motionless robots. The silent machines stand in rows of ten, their collective, unmoving gaze fixed on the white tower. The path out of the area lies to the east."

Part - Genesis Factory

Genesis Path GP-1 is a room. It is east of CG-1.
The description is "The smooth white form of the Genesis Tower extends above you, its massive height dwarfing the buildings of the ruined city. Protected by encircling defensive walls, the ground around the tower is strangely pristine, its surface untouched by the armageddon that turned the surrounding world to ash. Marble statues line the sides of the stone path that leads up to the base of the tower, their arms extended overhead, forming a series of arches. To the north, the tower's open doorway beckons. The ruined city lies to the south."

	The genesis tower, defensive walls, marble statues, stone path, and doorway are backdrops in GP-1.
	The description of the genesis tower is "Up close, the tower is just as featureless and uniform as from afar. The surface of the tower is marble-like in texture, but synthetic."
	The description of the defensive walls is "The walls are constructed from a thick porcelain-alloy armor, rendering them highly resistant to most forms of weaponry."
	The description of the marble statues is "The statues are larger-than-life depictions of human males in ancient military garb, holding long, bladed weapons in their outstretched hands."
	The description of the stone path is "The path is made up of hexagonal cobblestones meshed together."
	The description of the doorway is "An open archway breaks the surface of the tower, revealing a darkened room beyond."

Genesis Access GA-1 is a room. It is north of GP-1.
The description is "At first glance, it seems as if the interior of the tower has no walls. The tower courtyard, defensive wall, and the tops of buildings are still perfectly visible, holographically displayed on the inside of the tower by a ring of minuscule projectors that inscribe the edges of the ceiling, giving the effect that you are standing below a floating block of marble. Another statue stands on a pedestal in the center of the room, its outstretched hands cupped together as if begging for something. There is a plaque affixed to the front of the pedestal."

Before entering GA-1, say "As you cross the threshold, lights snap on, filling the room with harsh blue-white light."

	The defensive walls, marble statues, stone path, and husks of buildings are in GA-1.

	The statue, pedestal, and minuscule projectors are scenery in GA-1.
	The plaque is part of the pedestal.

[This room should work like an elevator. Once activated (by giving the statue an item?), the door closes and it begins to move upward. As it moves, the view outside changes, "rewinding" back to a view from when the tower was first constructed. By the time it reaches the top, the view shows a thriving utopian metropolis.

"With a sudden jolt, the room begins to accelerate upward. From your holographic viewpoint, you can see the courtyard slip away below you, the line of statues becoming smaller and smaller as the room rises.
[paragraph break]
For several moments, the only thing you can see is the surface of the external defensive wall.
[paragraph break]
Suddenly, the elevator clears the top of the wall, bringing the city in to view. With a start, you realize that something is very off about the landscape that pans out around you. As the room gains speedâ€¦ (In progress)

"

Genesis Overlook is a room. It is above GA-1.
The description is "The elevator has reached its final stop at the pinnacle of the Genesis Tower. At this great hight, you can feel the tower sway slightly in the wind."

Last after going to Genesis Overlook for the first time:
	say "No... that's not entirely true. You are swaying, but not from the wind...";
	pause game with alert;
	transfer the player to Antivirus Coprocessor;
	try silently looking.
